<ol>
<li>
(a)
A video game is often produced by a development team consisting of several members. 
In industry, team size can vary from 20 to 100 or more members, depending on the game's scope.
In such a team, represented are, e.g., producers, artists, programmers, designers, audio specialists, and finally, testers.
(And more..?)
Describe the tasks and responsibilities of different members of a game team.
<p></p>
(b)
Describe in detail the tasks a game programmer may be involved with.
Of course, the task of a game programmer is to develop game software 
- or other related software (such as various supportive tools). 
Some problem areas may require expert knowledge and specialized studies, and 
others are more general in nature. 
List out different kinds of software a game programmer might 
produce in a video game production.
<p></p>
Use available sources and online materials for answering these questions.  
E.g., access Wiki about
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_programmer">Game programmer</a>,
and similar information.
<!--
Introduce yourself, and tell about your prior studies and
programming background. 
What programming languages do you know?
Have you ever implemented games of your own?
What are your interests and goals regarding this course?
Have your any thoughts about what kind of game you would like
to design and implement?
-->
<p></p></li><li>
Explain the following items concerning games and
graphics technology.
When necessary, 
use online sources and  materials for answering the questions.  
<br>&nbsp;
<ol type="1">
<li> 
First of all, tell
what was the first video game you played - more or less seriously.
What do you remember about its plot or themes - what did impress you about the game?
Describe briefly its technical features and requirements (as far as you can).
Can it still be run on some available environment?
</li><li>
What are DirectX and OpenGL used for? 
How do they resemble/differ from each other?
</li><li>
What is the most popular programming language used for game implementations?
Try to explain why. What are its main characteristics?
</li><li>
What is a GPU? Why is it needed? 
Find out and describe briefly its inner operations
and architecture.
</li><li>
What is a <em>shader</em> in computer graphics?
</ol>
<p></p></li><li>
Explain the following items concerning .NET technology.
<br>&nbsp;
<ol type="1">
<li> 
Explain the terms CLR, CIL, and DLL related to .NET.
</li><li>
Both Java and C# were designed to be "type-safe" languages.
Type safety is related to both "strong typing" and exhaustive 
(comprehensive and complete) run-time checking.
Explore from available sources what "type safety" means in programming languages.
<!--
What is a .NET <em>assembly</em>?
</li><li>
Does .NET support <em>separate compilation</em>?
If so, explain how.
-->
</li><li>
What is meant by a "value type" in .NET?
Give examples what these values types are good for.
Are there possibly any drawbacks or limitations associated with 
using such value types?
</li><li>
.NET &amp; C# do somewhat resemble Java technology and platforms.
What are the main differences? 
</li></ol>

<p></p></li><li>- 5.

Get access to (or install for yourself) a Visual Studio C# 
environment (the 2010 version is required for XNA 4.0).
Get the "<em>Hello, world</em>!" program in C# to work. 
Compile and run it.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Add some variable declarations and statements that use
them to the <em>Main</em> method. Make some deliberate errors
to the program, and study how the C# compiler complains about 
them.
Explore the user interface and features of Visual Studio.
<!--
Also, devise a program that ends with a run-time error.
Explain what happens.
-->
Describe and discuss your experiences.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Find out what kind of different files can appear as parts of 
a Visual Studio C# project. Which of these does the
programmer write or provide herself, and what are
generated by the programming environment?
